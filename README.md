# JVM Custom Memory Arena (Learning Project)

This project is a from-scratch, educational implementation of a manual memory arena in Java, built to understand how low-level memory, pointers, and data structures actually work beneath high-level language abstractions.
 
The goal is to learn how memory and garbage collection (GC) works by explicitly managing it.

This repository documents that learning process through a progressively built system.

---

## Motivation

After ~4 years of programming in Java, a persistent, sizable chunk of its functionality as a language still feels opaque and abstract because of how it manages things under the hood.

- Objects appear without visible allocation
- Memory is automatically managed
- References feel disconnected from actual memory

This project removes that abstraction.

Everything here is built on top of a single `byte[]`, and all structures, safety measures, and meaning are implemented manually.

The design emphasizes explicit control and fail-fast behavior so that incorrect assumptions about memory usage surface immediately.

---

## Project Overview

At its core, this project implements a **manual memory arena**:

- Memory is allocated explicitly
- All reads and writes are bounds-checked
- Data structures are constructed by defining layouts over raw bytes
- Pointers are represented as integer offsets
- Invalid memory access fails immediately

The project incrementally builds higher-level behavior on top of this foundation in a controlled and well-defined manner.

---

## Core Concepts Implemented

### 1. Memory Arena

The arena is a contiguous block of memory represented by a `byte[]` and a single allocation pointer (`offset`).

```
[ allocated memory | unallocated memory ]
                 ^
               offset
```

Rules:
- Memory must be allocated before use
- Reads and writes are only allowed inside the allocated region
- Resetting the arena invalidates all previously allocated addresses

This mirrors modern arena allocators used in professional systems programming.

---

### 2. Strict Allocation Model

This project uses a strict safety model:

- All memory access is validated against the current allocation boundary
- Reading or writing outside allocated memory throws immediately
- There is no silent memory corruption

This forces correct reasoning and makes bugs obvious.

---

### 3. Primitive Storage (Big Endian)

Primitive values are stored manually.

Example: storing an `int`

- An `int` occupies 4 bytes
- Values are stored in big-endian order
- Bit shifting and masking are used explicitly
- Reconstruction is performed byte-by-byte

This makes integer representation and endianness explicit instead of implicit.

---

### 4. Struct-like Layouts (Nodes)

On top of raw memory, the project defines structured layouts.

A Node is defined as:

```
Node (8 bytes total):
+------------------+
| value (int)      |  offset + 0
+------------------+
| next (int)       |  offset + 4
+------------------+
```

Nodes are not Java objects.

A node is simply:
- an integer address
- a fixed memory layout
- helper methods that interpret bytes at that address

This mirrors C-style structs and pointers.

---

### 5. Pointers and Sentinel Values

Pointers are represented as integer offsets into the arena.

Rules:
- A pointer is either:
  - a valid address inside allocated memory
  - `-1`, used as a null sentinel
- All pointers are validated before use
- Invalid pointers throw immediately

This makes pointer semantics explicit and visible.

---

### 6. Data Structures Built from Raw Memory

Using the node layout, the project implements a linked list:

- Nodes allocated from the arena
- `next` pointers stored as raw addresses
- Traversal implemented manually
- No Java collections or object allocation involved

This demonstrates how high-level data structures emerge from low-level memory rules.

---

## Safety Mechanisms

Two layers of validation are implemented.

### `checkAddr(addr, bytesNeeded)`

Ensures:
- The address is non-negative
- The requested memory range fits entirely inside allocated memory

Used for primitive reads and writes.

---

### `checkNodePtr(ptr)`

Ensures:
- The pointer is `-1` (null), or
- The pointer references a full node inside allocated memory

Used for all node-based operations.

---

## Scope and Design Constraints

- Not a production allocator
- Not optimized for performance
- Not concurrent
- Not using JVM internals or Unsafe
- Not a garbage collector replacement

The implementation prioritizes clarity, correctness, and explicit control over performance or feature completeness.

## What This Project Teaches

- How memory is laid out at the byte level
- Why bounds checking matters
- How pointers actually work
- How struct layout is a design decision
- How data structures are built from raw memory
- Why high-level languages feel safe

---

## Current Capabilities

- Manual memory allocation
- Big-endian integer storage
- Strict bounds checking
- Struct-like node layouts
- Pointer validation
- Linked list traversal

---

## Planned Next Steps

- Separate node logic into a dedicated NodeStore
- Add additional struct types (arrays, strings)
- Improve diagnostics and error reporting
- Optional alignment guarantees
- Unit tests for failure cases
- Memory layout diagrams

---

## Audience

This project is intended for:

- Developers interested in systems-level concepts in managed languages
- Students studying memory management, data layout, or low-level runtime behavior
- Engineers who want a concrete model for how high-level abstractions map to raw memory

---

## Final Note

This project is designed to model memory management concepts precisely and transparently.

Every abstraction in the code exists to make memory behavior observable and debuggable. The focus is on correctness, explicit invariants, and clear structure rather than convenience or hidden behavior.
